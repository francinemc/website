The Bridgestone Potenza RE980AS+ is an Ultra High Performance All-Season tire designed for sports cars, sporty coupes, and performance sedans. It provides high-speed capability, predictable handling in both dry and wet conditions, and year-round performance, even in light snow. The tire features an asymmetric tread pattern with chamfered edges for improved rubber-to-road contact and quiet comfort. Its 3D full-depth sipes enhance tread stability, while high sipe density ensures traction in slippery conditions. The tread pattern facilitates water evacuation, reducing the risk of hydroplaning. The internal construction includes polyester sidewall plies and twin steel belts for responsive handling and high-speed capability.
